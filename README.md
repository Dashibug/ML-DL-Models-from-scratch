# The goal is to build an intuitive understanding of how each algorithm works under the hood.
# Machine Learning Models
Implementation of classic ML and DL models from scratch: theoretical and practical parts
# Classic ML:
📈 Regression
Linear Regression – with gradient descent & analytical solution

Logistic Regression – binary classification using sigmoid

👥 Instance-Based Learning
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Clustering – K-Means and other unsupervised techniques

🧱 Linear & Non-linear Models
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees

Random Forests

🚀 Ensemble Methods
Gradient Boosting – from basic to advanced

Custom Boosting Class – flexible implementation for experimenting

🛠️ Model Selection & Optimization
Cross-Validation

Grid Search

Randomized Search

Bayesian Optimization (optional add-on)

⚖️ Theory & Diagnostics
